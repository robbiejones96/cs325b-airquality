The data processing stage will expect a folder in the home directory that
exactly mirrors the structure of the Google Cloud bucket. The relevant folders
are below:

es262-airquality/
├── epa
├── GHCND_weather
├── modis
│   ├── 2016_processed_100x100
│   ├── 2017_processed_100x100
│   ├── 2018_processed_100x100
│   └── 2019_processed_100x100
└── sentinel
    ├── 2016
    ├── 2017
    └── Metadata

There should also be a code/ folder in the home directory as well for both
the data preprocessing and model training/evaluation stages. 

Included in the .zip file is a processed_data.tar.gz file. When uncompressed, 
it gives the following directory:

processed_data/
├── test_sites_master_csv_2017.csv
├── train_sites_master_csv_2017.csv
└── val_sites_master_csv_2017.csv

These store the train/val/test data for the already-preprocessed non-image data.
It's highly recommended that you use this data and just run the preprocessing
stage for the Sentinel-2 data (see run_instructions.txt). Note that this folder
should also be in the home directory.
