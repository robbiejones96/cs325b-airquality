Make sure to read through installation_instructions.txt and
environment_setup.txt first!

main.sh is the entry point for the preprocessing and training code. The
following are valid arguments to main.sh:

--skip_preprocessing : Skips all preprocessing and just runs training code.
--install_gdal : Install GDAL for Python (see installation_instructions.txt)
--process_sentinel_only : If --skip_preprocessing is not present, then this
                          flag will skip all preprocessing code except for
                          the Sentinel-2 images.
                          
With no arguments, main.sh will run the entire preprocessing
stage, and then run training. The preprocessing stage takes a very long time, 
so it's highly recommended to use the preprocessed files provded in 
processed_data.tar.gz (see environment_setup.txt), and run main.sh with the
process_sentinel_only flag when running for the first time. Subsequent 
training-only runs can obviously include the --skip_preprocessing flag. Make
sure main.sh is inside the home directory when running!

main.sh also creates three additional subdirectories in the home directory:
'predictions/', 'plots/', and 'checkpoints/', which hold model prediction 
files, plots/figures, and saved model weights, respectively.

The 6 relevant models files (located in code/models/) that will be invoked are: 
    1) knn_baseline.py                  -- Nearest Neighbors Baseline model
    2) overfitting_nonsentinel_net.py   -- Non-Sentinel Net
    3) cnn.py                           -- Sentinel-2 Net
    4) frozen_combined_net.py           -- Frozen Pretrained Multi-Modal Net
    5) finetuned_combined_net.py        -- Finetuned Pretrained Multi-Modal Net
    6) cnn_combined.py                  -- End-to-End Multi-Modal Net

These are already invoked in main.sh, but we wanted to name them explicitly, since
there are a few additional files in models/ that are not used. These 6 models
can be run individually, if needed (look in main.sh to see how they are invoked).
