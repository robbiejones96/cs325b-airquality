Make sure to read through installation_instructions.txt and
environment_setup.txt first!

main.sh is the entry point for the preprocessing and training code. The
following are valid arguments to main.sh:

--skip_preprocessing : Skips all preprocessing and just runs training code.
--install_gdal : Install GDAL for Python (see installation_instructions.txt)
--process_sentinel_only : If --skip_preprocessing is not present, then this
                          flag will skip all preprocessing code except for
                          the Sentinel-2 images.
                          
With no arguments, main.sh will run the entire preprocessing
stage, and then run training. The preprocessing stage takes a very long time, 
so it's highly recommended to use the preprocessed files provded in 
processed_data.tar.gz (see environment_setup.txt), and run main.sh with the
process_sentinel_only flag when running for the first time. Subsequent 
training-only runs can obviously include the --skip_preprocessing flag. Make
sure main.sh is inside the home directory when running!
