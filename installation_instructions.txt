This project uses Python 3.7.4. The majority of the the necessary libraries
are listed in requirements.txt, and these can be installed in one shot via

    pip install -r requirements.txt

One package that requires some extra work is GDAL for Python to handle .tif 
files. GDAL requires some extra binaries and C libraries installed before the 
Python installation will work, and this can sometimes cause some issues. On 
Debian Stretch, the following lines have been successful:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa && sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
    sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
    pip install --user pygdal==2.1.2.3
    
In main.sh, you can include --install_gdal as a flag, and the lines above will 
run to attempt installing GDAL. However, you may need Google to troubleshoot any 
installation errors and finish the installation manually. The following links
